    <h1>How the NowTV Test works</h1>
    <p>The Bill Test app uses AngularJS to retrieve the bill data from the remote REST endpoint. It then formats the
    bill by iterating through the data structure, rendering the HTML via ng-repeat, making the HTML nice and light.</p>
    <p>I follow <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide">John Papa's style guide</a> with my AngularJS code, and so have kept my controllers as light as possible,
    pushing all business logic out into the billsJsonAPIData service.</p>

    <h2>Missing Items</h2>
    </p>
    <p>The user interface is currently quite basic. I've used Bootstrap for speed, but there are no nice
    accordions or other UI features that I'd ordinarily use.</p>
