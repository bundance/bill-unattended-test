    <h1>How the NowTV Test works</h1>
    <p>The Bill Test app uses AngularJS to retrieve the bill data from the remote REST endpoint. It then formats the
    bill by iterating through the data structure, rendering the HTML via ng-repeat, making the HTML nice and light.</p>
    <p>I follow <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide">John Papa's style guide</a> with my AngularJS code, and so have kept my controllers as light as possible,
    pushing all business logic out into the billsJsonAPIData service.</p>

    <h2>Missing Items</h2>
    <p>This test has been written while on holiday with a Wife who's feeling very neglected! Accordingly, as I hope
    you understand, there are a number of features not added that would be added if this were production code,
    and not being written under duress!
    </p>
    <p>The primary missing feature is any form of intuitive user interface. I've used Bootstrap for speed, but there are no nice
    accordions or other UI features that I'd ordinarily use. If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/bundance/tr-demo</p>">tr-demo</a>
    repo, though, you should see examples of UI components I normally put in when I have time.</p>
    <p>The code is also crying out for some directives, but again, time was limited I'm afraid!</p>
